<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a recently graduated FY1 doctor working in Raigmore hospital, Inverness from July 2022. In my FY2 year I will be undertaking a 4 month medical education block. I am new to website developement and have made this website both as a personal project and in the hope that it might become a useful place to share resources with students.
