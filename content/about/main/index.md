  I have recently completed my MBChB at the University of Edinburgh. During my studies I undertook an intercalated BMedSci in Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine. For my thesis I joined the baillielab and carried out a genomics project looking at genes associated with mortality in sepsis. 
  
  Since then I have continued to work on projects within the baillielab. Research outputs from these projects are viewable by clicking the 'publications' tab in the header. 
  
  I made this website using Hugo, blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify. If you want to do the same, follow the instructions [here](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/start/)
