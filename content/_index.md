description: |
  I am a medical student with an interest in research and medical education. In July 2022 I will start a Specialised Foundation Programme undertaking a medical education-themed post based in Raigmore, Inverness. I completed my MBChB and intercalated BMedSci at the University of Edinburgh. In my spare time I pursue outdoor sports such as hiking, climbing and mountaineering at an amateur level - I also enjoy thinking and writing about these pursuits.
